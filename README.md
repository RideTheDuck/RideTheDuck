* Database - Firebase 
  * We decided to use Firebase as we wanted to try a different way of storing data than we have already used. Firebase seemed to have easy integration with React Native and was more lightweight than using another database framework (for example PostgreSQL.)
* Front end - React Native 
  * React Native is something the team had not used before. We had some exposure to developing web apps using ReactJS however for mobile development React Native seemed the logical next step in order to try something somewhat new, especially when developing our first mobile application.
* Back end- Node.JS
* Testing - Jest
